Numerical library written in Go.

Notes
-----

This repository is currently under construction and should not yet be considered
reliable. A few subpackages have been thoroughly tested and meet my standards
for for being acceptable for scientific computing, but until the entire library
is ready, I suggest others search out other numerical libraries.
